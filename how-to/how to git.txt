navigate to local git repo

open "git bash" here by right clicking an empty space (alternatively, git here anywhere then navigate to directory containing the code)

git add * to stage files to add to github that you have changed

git status to check

git checkout -b <branch name> to make a new branch for changes

git commit -m <message here>

git push -u origin <branch name>
-- beware you might run into authentication issues when changing password
-- sequence to remove origin and add back: git remote -v ; git remote remove origin ; git remote add origin <repo>

Go to Github website and view the pull to merge it.

Once merged
git checkout master
-- swap to master branch

git pull --prune
-- update your local repo with what's changed on github

if you need to make additional changes while a branch hasn't been merged, just use
git commit -m <message>
